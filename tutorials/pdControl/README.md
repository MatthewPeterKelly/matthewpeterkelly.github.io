#README  --  Proportional-derivative controller

## NOTES:
- Much of this code is inspired by a tutorial on [Red Blob Games](http://www.redblobgames.com/articles/curved-paths/making-of.html) 
- Most of the JavaScript is in pdControl.js
- index.html is the main page, mostly html, with a bit of javascript

## TODO:
 - Make the plot of the time response next to the x-y interactive gui
 - Another possibility would be to put the phase-space and time?
 - Key idea: be able to see everything at once
