## Industry

### Boston Dynamics: 2018 - Present

I am a robotics engineer at Boston Dynamics, where I write control software for the [Atlas humanoid](https://www.bostondynamics.com/atlas) robot.

I am on the team that implemented the whole-body model-predictive control architecture that enabled the hydraulic Atlas to do parkour ([Atlas | Partners in Parkour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4DML7FIWk), [Atlas Gets a Grip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e1_QhJ1EhQ)).

More recently I've been focused on the broader control software architecture, upgrading and modernizing our control infrastructure to run on the fully electric Atlas humanoid robot:

### Rethink Robotics: 2016-2018

Previously, I was at Rethink Robotics, where I developed control and trajectory generation software for their Sawyer robot.

## Academic

### Cornell University: 2011-2016

My graduate work at Cornell focused on nonlinear controller design for robots with interesting dynamics, advised by Professor [Andy Ruina](http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/). I also developed an interest in numerical methods, especially those used for simulation, control, and optimization. I enjoy writing tutorials and teaching.

I received both a M.S. (2014) and Ph.D. (2016) in mechanical engineering, with a minor in computer science.

My dissertation had two major projects. The first project was writing my own [trajectory optimization software](https://github.com/MatthewPeterKelly/OptimTraj), along with a long [tutorial paper on trajectory optimization](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/16M1062569). The second project was developing a robust walking controller and implementing it on the [Cornell Ranger](http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/ranger/Ranger2011/) walking robot.

### Tufts University: 2007-2011

I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Tufts University in 2011, along with a minor in music. I did my honors [thesis project](research/index.html#Research_BoneSaw) with professor [Tom James](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/faculty/james-thomas-james3.html), where I designed, built, and tested a new type of bone saw. I also did a research [project in robotics](research/index.html#Research_RheometerControl), jointly advised by [Chris Rogers](https://crogers.pages.tufts.edu/) and [Gareth McKinley](http://web.mit.edu/nnf/), developing a non-linear controller for a fluid mechanics testing robot.

## Personal

I grew up in a small town near the Catskill Mountains in New York and have lived in various places around the northeast USA since then. Now I live outside of Boston with my wife and our young children.

I'm interested in gardening, hiking, cooking, woodworking, and contra dancing.
