← Trajectory Optimization Tutorial: Slides ( html )</a>
<p>This presentation is an excellent place to start learning about
trajectory optimization. It was designed to be accessable to anyone
with a basic background in numerical methods. I watch the comments
on the YouTube video, and will generally answer questions within a
few days.</p>

"https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/16M1062569">← An Introduction
to Trajectory Optimization ( .pdf )</a>
<p>This tutorial is targeted at first-year graduate students that
are interested in learning about trajectory optimization. It starts
with a broad overview of the field and then teaches the basics of
direct collocation through simple examples. The paper is 44 pages
long and will be published in SIAM Review in December 2017.</p>

Aiming a canon: learn trajectory optimization by picture ( html
)</a>
<p>I think about trajectory optimization (and most math) visually,
and I find that visual demonstrations can be a useful teaching
tool. This tutorial shows how shooting and collocation methods work
using the example of aiming a canon. Rather than detailed
mathematics, I focus instead on making clear visual representations
of the techniques.</p>

Trajectory Optimization Terminology ( html )</a>
<p>Trajectory optimization is a field that is filled with complex
terminology. This is made more challenging by the fact that many
author use the same words to mean different things, or different
words to mean the same thing. Here I walk through several
sub-topics and clearly define and provide context for several of
the most important terms.</p>
<a class="navLink" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00284.pdf">←
Transcription Methods for Trajectory Optimization ( .pdf )</a>
<p>I wrote this 14 page report when I was first learning to write
my own trajectory optimization code and learn about trajectory
optimization as it is used in legged locomotion. It focuses on
transcription methods, including both collocation and shooting
methods, as well as how to deal with hybrid systems.</p>

<h2>Trajectory Optimization - Implementation</h2>
<div id="TrajOpt_Implementation" class="figure">
<p>In order to really learn trajectory optimization you will need
to write some code.<br>
Here are a few examples of how to implement trajectory optimization
in Matlab.</p>

Aiming a canon</a>
<p>Matlab implementation of the canon-aiming tutorial above.
Contains simple implementations with single shooting, multiple
shooting, and direct collocation.</p>
<a class="navLink" href=
"https://github.com/MatthewPeterKelly/dscTutorials/tree/master/Trajectory_Optimization_Hammer_Example">←
An optimal hammer swing</a>
<p>This simple tutorial shows how to implement a multiple shooting
method in Matlab. The example problem is that of a periodic hammer
swing, where the hammer bounces off of a table. It shows how to do
trajectory optimization on a (very simple) hybrid system.</p>
<a class="navLink" href=
"https://github.com/MatthewPeterKelly/OptimTraj">← OptimTraj:
Trajectory optimization library for Matlab</a>
<p>OptimTraj is a general-purpose trajectory optimization library
that I wrote for Matlab. While writing it I made a special effort
to make the code readable with lots of comments and a clear
organization; it is designed to be read as a tutorial. OptimTraj
comes with several examples that show how to code up a variety of
problems, starting simple (pendulum) and working up to a walking
gait for a 5-link biped model.</p>
