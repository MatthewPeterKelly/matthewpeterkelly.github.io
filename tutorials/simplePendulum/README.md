# Pendulum Simulation

## Improvements
 - Change format to scrolling column instead of  wide screen
 - Connect parameters in simulation, math, and code using colors
 - Multiple plots:
     - energy vs time (total, potential, kinetic)
     - phase space
     - angle vs time
 - give suggestions for interesting parameters or things to do
 - only show code fragments on page. Provide links to download functional code in matlab (and maybe other launguages).
