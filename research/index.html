<div class="abstract">This page summarizes a variety of research
projects that I worked on, starting while I was an undergraduate at
Tufts University. The more recent projects were completed as part
of my PhD research at Cornell University, where I worked with
Professor <a href="http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/" target=

<h2>Robust control for Cornell Ranger</h2>
<p>One of the main research focuses in my PhD was developing a more
robust balance controller for the <a href=
"http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/locomotion_and_robotics/ranger/Ranger2011/"
target="blank">Cornell Ranger walking robot</a> . I developed a
controller architecture for the robot that allowed for automated
controller design, both in simulation and in hardware. The gains
for the balance controller were initially computed using
large-scale optimization in simulation. The simulation was designed
to include a wide range of disturbances, so that we could usually
transfer controllers directly from simulation to the real robot.
Once on the robot, the balance controller gains were fine-tuned
using optimization that was running in real-time on the robot.</p>

<h2>Trajectory optimization tutorials</h2>
<p>I spent much of my time at Cornell learning trajectory
optimization and coding up my own solvers. I found learning about
the subject fascinating, so I developed a set of tutorials for
trajectory optimization, including a long tutorial paper that is
published in SIAM.</p>

<h2>A Exam (thesis proposal)</h2>
<p>I took my A exam in August 2014. My proposal was on the topic of
'Heirarchical Biped Control'. The idea is to do step planning on a
reduced model of the robot, which is then used to help generate the
motor commands on the full model. In addition to my presentation, I
submitted three written reports.</p>

<h2>Q Exam (qualifying exam)</h2>
<p>For my qualifying exam (January 2012) I presented a simulation
of a tractor trailer truck driving backwards along a curving road.
It had partial sensing of its state using noisy sensors, and
control of the steering angle and travel speed (both of which were
bounded). State estimation was done using an extended Kalman filter
(EKF). Control was done by using a discrete linear quadratic
regulator (dLQR), on the linearized system (about the current state
estimate).</p>

<h2 id="Research_BoneSaw">Undergraduate Thesis - Bone Saw</h2>
<p>My undergraduate thesis project at Tufts University was
designing, fabricating, and testing a new type of surgical bone
saw. At the conclusion of the project I submitted provisional
patent for my saw design and published the experimental results in
the ASME Journal of Medical Devices. I was also worked on two
conference papers - one for my saw, and one for a saw designed by
another student.</p>

<h2 id="Research_RheometerControl">Non-linear control design for
extensional rheometer</h2>
<p>In my last year of undergrad, I worked as a research assistant
in the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/nnf/">Non-Newtonian Fluids lab
at MIT</a>, along with <a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/timothy-lannin/93/902/985">Tim
Lannin</a> and <a href=
"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/will-langford/16/880/164">Will
Langford</a>. Our goal was to design and implement a non-linear
tracking controller on their Filament Stretching Extensional
Rheometer (<a href=
"http://web.mit.edu/nnf/presentation/sld004.htm">FiSER</a>) and to
redesign the LabVIEW program that ran the experiments.</p>
<p>FiSER characterizes fluids by rapidly stretching them, and
measuring both the axial force on the fluid and the diameter of the
sample in real time. The original experiments were done by using
open-loop velocity profiles for the two measurement stages of the
device. We implemented a controller that adjusted the speed of the
stages in real-time to track a desired diameter profile in the
specimen. This was challenging because the reference trajectories
were all exponential, requiring the use of non-linear control
techniques. The data acquisition, control, and estimation code were
written in LabVIEW and compiled to a National Instruments cRIO and
FPGA.</p>

<h2>Journal of Chem. Education Paper</h2>
<p>As an freshman at Tufts University, I took a chemistry course,
which was designed to teach chemistry by attempting to answer the
question: "Is hydrogen the fuel of the future?". My final report
for the class was included in supplement of the paper that my
professor wrote about the course.</p>
