  <p>
    Suppose that you have a cannon, and you would like to hit a known target.
    To make things interesting, let's assume that there is air friction
    and that you would like to minimize the amount of powder used for the shot.
  </p>
  <p>
    This situation can be modeled as a boundary-value-problem,
    since you know where the trajectory (path of the cannon ball) should start and end.
    The goal is to find the trajectory, including the initial velocity of the cannon ball.
    We will assume that:<br>
    (1) the cannon ball is a point mass,<br>
    (2) air friction is modeled using quadratic drag, and<br>
    (3) amount of powder is proportional to initial speed squared.<br>
    Thus we can write out the problem and draw a nice picture as shown below.

  <h2>Solution: Single Shooting</h2>

  <p>Single shooting works by approximating the
    trajectory using a single simulation. In other words, fire the cannon,
    check where the ball landed, adjust the initial speed, repeat. In math
    terms, the error between the target and where the cannon ball landed
    is called a defect. The optimization algorithm will try to find the
    initial speed such that this defect driven to zero. It turns out that
    single shooting is an effective method for simple problems (like this
  one), but it will fail on problems that are more difficult.</p>

  <h2>Solution: Multiple Shooting</h2>

  <p>Multiple shooting is very similar to single
    shooting, but it turns out to be much more robust on difficult
    problems. It works by breaking the original problem into many small
    problems, and then solving them in parallel. At the end, each segment
  is constrained to connect to the previous one.</p>

  <h2>Solution: Direct Collocation</h2>
  <p>Direct collocation is a bit more difficult
    to visualize, since there is no simulation step. Instead, the
    trajectory is approximated using a piecewise polynomial. Physics are
    satisfied by requiring that the dynamics (derivative of the state)
    match the derivative of the polynomial at each collocation point - the
    points that implicitly define the polynomial. In effect, shooting
    methods satisfy dynamics using explicit integration, while collocation
  methods use implicit integration.</p>
  <p>
    There are a wide variety of collocation schemes. Orthogonal
    collocation schemes, developed for computing satellite trajectories,
    use a small number of high-order polynomials. They are extremely
    accurate for problems well behaved solutions. The other extreme is
    direct collocation, which uses a large number of low-order polynomials
    to represent the solution. It tends to be slightly less accurate, but
    can be more robust. Some sophisticated methods (<a
    href="http://www.gpops2.com/">GPOPS</a>) use an adaptive meshing
    routine to iterative change the number of segments and order of the
    polynomials.
